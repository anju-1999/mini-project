# BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS USING DEEP LEARNING
  
  Now a days breast cancer is one of the deadliest disease found in most of the matured women. Cancer is curable 
once it is diagnosed at earlier stages. But once it goes to the worst stages it is difficult to cure and which may even 
lead to death. In this study, it is focussed on developing a model in which it gives a clinical support to the physician 
for earlier diagnosis of breast cancer.In our model we use image processing technique and convolutional 
neural network were used which is a layered approach in deep learning.
